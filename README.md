## My attempt to update Colt Steele's Udemy React Course

here is the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) I am talking about

### How to Get it Running

1. Download the Code as a .zip file, then extract into a folder
2. Open up a terminal, change directory into the folder you just extracted
3. Run `npm i`, after all dependencies have installed, run `npm start`
4. Enjoy!
